# Project Rules for AI Assistant

## 1. Environment & Execution
- **Docker Only**: This project runs strictly inside Docker.
    - **NEVER** run `python` or `pip` directly on the host (Windows).
    - **ALWAYS** use: `docker compose exec -T core python <script>`
    - **NEVER** suggest `pip install -r requirements.txt` locally.

## 2. Log Generation (`cognizer.py`)
- **Action-Based Logic**: We prioritize *what* the user is doing (Window Titles) over *which app* is open.
- **Config**: Categorization rules are in `config/categories.yaml`.
- **Logs**:
    - Raw logs: `data/logs/sensor_log_*.json`
    - Uncategorized apps: `data/logs/uncategorized_activities.log`
- **Output**: Daily journals in `data/journals/` or configured Vault path.

## 3. Language
- **Language**: English is preferred for logs to ensure best performance with Local LLMs.
